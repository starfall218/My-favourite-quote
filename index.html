          it emphasizes on not letting your past or <br />

           power to change our stories and choose who we want<br />
           to be irrespective of our background.

      <p>"Listen to me. You are enough. You’ve always been enough. The world often tries to convince us that we need to be more, to do more, to be someone else in order to fit in, to succeed, or to be valued. But let me tell you this: you do not need to change to be worthy.

        Confidence comes not from the approval of others, but from the realization that you, as you are, are powerful. You are capable. You are deserving. The key to confidence is understanding that your value is inherent, not earned by what others say or think about you.      
      </p>

          <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/157/686/original/Maya_Angelou.jpg?1739569966" width="100%" alt="Maya Angelou">
        </div>
      <p>You will face challenges. You will face doubts, fears, and setbacks. But every time you rise, every time you push forward despite the obstacles, your confidence grows. Confidence isn't about perfection; it’s about believing in your strength to face what lies ahead, no matter the odds.
        
        So, stand tall. Walk with purpose. And never, ever doubt that you have everything you need inside you to conquer the world. Remember, as Maya Angelou said, ‘We may encounter many defeats, but we must not be defeated.’ Keep going, because you are enough, and you always will be."</p>
